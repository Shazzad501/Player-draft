Description:-
The project appears to be a Player Draft tool, allowing users to create and manage drafts,
 likely for fantasy sports or similar team selection activities. Users can add players to 
 their draft, view selections, and possibly organize teams. The layout emphasizes 
 simplicity for smooth navigation and use.



This project uses various technologies, including HTML, CSS, and the Tailwind CSS framework
 along with the Daisy UI component library. It incorporates JavaScript and JSX with the 
 React library, using Vite as the development environment. React Toastify is also included 
 for notifications. Finally, the project is deployed on Netlify.



This project offers a range of features, including a beautiful, responsive design with a 
well-crafted navigation bar. A 'Claim Free Credit' button allows users to earn 500M coins 
per click, visible in the navigation bar, which can be used to buy players. The main 
section includes player cards with a 'Choose Player' button; if your coin balance is lower
than the player price, you cannot buy the player. You can add up to 7 players to your 
team. The project also features alerts for low coins or a full roster, plus a footer and a 
playful newsletter subscription button.
